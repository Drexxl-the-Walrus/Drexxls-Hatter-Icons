Some custom made icons for the amazing Hatter icon theme (https://github.com/Mibea/Hatter).

There were some games and apps without icons so I decided to practice my vector-art skills.

Most icons were made by recoloring an existing one and adding another logo. If the Papirus icon theme (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) had a logo i would use it. Otherwise I would find an image to use.
